# HideSharedPost



Scrolling through Facebook newsfeed is tough when someone keeps sharing posts like crazy. And stalking my crush was a pain too -_- . She keeps sharing stuffs like crazy. Anyhow that's when I got this idea to create a browser extension for chrome to hide those irritating posts. As for now I am not gonna add it to chrome store. Too much pain



## Features

- Hide shared posts of specific users
- Hide shared posts of everyone

## Features for future

- Hide facebook adds
- Create a custom popup menu with all the features

## How to add

- Download this repository as zip then unzip or clone to local.
- Then go to chrome [extension](chrome://extensions/) . => That three dot in top right => More tools =>Extensions
- Enable developer mode
- Click load unpacked button
- And then select the downloaded folder
